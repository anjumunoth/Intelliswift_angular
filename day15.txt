Why directives are needed ?
	-- Represent element in a specific way
	-- Used to change the values of the inbuilt attributes of that element
	-- 
why a custom directive ??
	-- Create a tool tip -- structural custom attribute
	-- Hover a image -- new image; change the src attribute -- custom attribute directive 
	
Custom directive
	-- For the element on which the directive has been applied 
		-- changed the attribute value for that element
		-- Work with the events on that element
	-- Same directive can be applied to multiple elements of different/same type
	-- Can pass Additional attribute(s) to the directive using @Input
	-- Can we bind events to the element on which directive ahs been added -- YES
