Pipes:
	Pure pipe
	Impure pipe

Pipe.pure?: boolean | undefined
When true, the pipe is pure, meaning that the transform() method is invoked only when its input arguments change. Pipes are pure by default.

If the pipe has internal state (that is, the result depends on state other than its arguments), set pure to false. In this case, the pipe is invoked on each change-detection cycle, even if the arguments have not changed.

If the transform is a pure function , create a pure pipe
If the transform is a impure function , create a impure pipe

Pure pipe 			Impure pipe
1. Pure Pipe is executed only when there are changes to the args; Every change detection cycle will execute the impure pipe
2. Pure pipe -- One instance ; Impure pipe -- multiple instances
3. Pure pipe -- Optimise app performance; impure pipe -- degrade the app performance


Tree shaking: dead code elimination
	-- unused modules/components/pipes,directives
	-- remove them for the bundle
	-- Setting the optimisation to true in angular.json
Enables optimization of the build output. Including minification of scripts and styles, tree-shaking, dead-code elimination, inlining of critical CSS and fonts inlining
