Lifecycle of component:
	-- Methods 
	-- Implicitly invoked
	-- Invoked only once, invoked multiple times
	-- Cannot be invoked explicitly
-- 3 phases
	-- Mounting, Updation, UnMounting
-- Mounting:
	-- stages through which component goes through during the loading of component
	-- constructor
	-- @Input receives the data from the parent
	-- ....
	-- Loading the UI
	-- ngOnInit

constructor:
	-- First method implicitly invoked when the component is invoked
	-- Executed only once during the entire lifecycle
	-- Initialise the component's properties
	-- Here the data from the parent is not available in the @Input 
	-- Also have to initialise the @Input as well

ngOnInit
	-- Another lifecycle method
	-- Implicitly invoked
	-- Invoked only once
	-- Cannot be invoked explicitly
	-- The data from the parent is available in the @Input's
	-- Implement an OnInit interface
		-- implement ngOnInit
	-- purpose --
		-- Give a request to the server to fetch some data
		-- Subscribe to 3rd party 
		-- Set up timers

Decorators:
	-- We can pass some metadata to the decorators
		-- As a configuration object

@Input
	-- Decorator
	-- When the data is received
	-- data type
	-- Required
	-- Getter and setters
		-- Transformation on the data
		-- Adv:
			-- Perform the transformation
			-- Manipulate the private variable
		-- Disadv:
			-- Need a private variable and have to set up getters and setter properties
	-- transform metadata
		-- Define a function on how to do transformation
		-- Transformation on the data
		-- First transformation will be performed and then the data will be assigned
		-- Better practice then getters and setters
		-- Rules to be followed when working with transform
			-- transform function 
				-- no heavy tasks to be performed
				-- cannot be set conditionally
				-- Should be pure function (no side effects)
					-- requests to server -- NO

	-- alias meta data
	-- booleanAttribute and numberAttribute
