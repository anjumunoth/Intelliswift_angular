Microservices (server app): group of API's together form a single app;
Monolithic application: a single app (a single microservice) 

Today -- Microservices(server side)
	Adv:
	-- easier to maintain
	-- modularity
	-- deployment is easier; maintanence, testing is easier
	
Complex app on the server-- use microservices; (agile)

Front end -- complex -- single app or multiple apps combined into one single app

Macroservices: microservices concept applied to the front end

2 questions:
1. what kind of styling
2. Do u want to do routing or not -- Yes

Angular -- SPA -- will have one index.html page; On navigation, different contents are loaded on the same index.html 

Routing:
	-- Pattern matching
	-- switch

1. Is the url address case sensitive -- YES
	-- For both the routes, have Corresponding route in the routes array and in the routerLink directive
	-- Best practice -- dont have the route names in lower case and upper case
2. What if i type a route which does not exists -- empty contents as part of router outlet and  redirect to localhost:4200;
3.
