Why Angular ? 
	-- technology(framework) for developing front end
	-- Partial updates of page 
	-- Reusability
	-- security 
		-- authentication
		-- authorisation
		-- Prevention third party attacks;(Bugs)
	-- Popularity 
		-- Speed
		-- Ease of development/maintanence
		-- Community support
		-- Compatibility with major browsers
		-- Bundle size -- Optimise -- Default
	-- SPA Single Page Application
		One html page gets loaded by browser ; user interaction -- update to the single html 
	-- Client Side Routing	
		menu; click on menu item ; new contents updated from the client side (no request to server)
	-- Server side routing
		menu; click on menu item; request sent to the server; based on request; send a response back to the client; client will populate the page based on response
	-- Unit testing, Integration testing
		-- Without the server 
		-- Test the front end seperately
		Karma test runner
		jasmine -- test cases
	-- MVC, MVVM
		-- Model, View, Controller
		View -- UI
		Model -- Data available as part of UI
		Controller -- Bridge between view and model
			--  populate in the view the model data
			--  changes in the view have to be updated in the model
			--  view and model have to be in sync
	
	-- Two way data binding
		--data in the view and model have to be in sync
		-- communicate data between model and view -- data flows in both the directions
		-- from model --> view
		-- from view --> model

	-- MVVM 
		Model
		View
		ViewModel
	Versions:
		-- Angularjs(version 1) MVC 
		-- Angular2 MVVM (component based architecture)
		-- Angular4
		....Angular18
