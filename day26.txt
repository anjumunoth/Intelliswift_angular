Send the response as a stream of data.
Client -- receive the data as streams (chunks of data is going to coming in a sequential order)

Streams of data -- Observable

next 
-- function
-- get the data
-- called multiple times

error
	-- function
	-- called only once
	-- whenever there is an error in stream

complete
	-- function called when the stream is complete
	-- called only once

Subscribing -- Opening the tap
Unsubscribing from an Observable:
	-- Closing the tap


In the observer : give 3 function definitions : next, error, complete
Calling the function : as part of observable creation
