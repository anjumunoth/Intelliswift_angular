 Two way data binding:
or
Acheieved : One way data binding in both the directions

One way data binding in both the directions:

Clicked the button -->Passed the product details and flow of control --> One way data flow from view to model
In the event handler, set showAddToCart to true(model); AddToCart component got mounted; ---> One way data flow from model to view 



Only html,css, js:
	event; corresponding event handler -- in js file

Angular:
1. Event binding 
	-- One way data flow from the view to the model of the same component
	-- Working with angular events
	-- Bind the angular event with a event handler
	-- Enclose the angular event in paranthesis
	-- Define the event handler -- in the same component's class (inside the class, outside the constructor)

Parent component-> Child component communication
	-- Sending some data from the parent to child component
	-- Parent: ProductList
	-- Child : AddToCart
	-- data : product on which the user has clicked on
1. Add the data(which has to be sent to the child) to the child component tag using attribute binding 
2. In the child component, will specify the data which will be received from the parent


<img [src]="productsArr[0].imgUrl" alt="Product Image" style="border:5px solid blue;"  />
1. Property binding : From Model-> View
2. Added it to a inbuilt property of img tag which is src as part of opening tag
3. Getting the value from a variable which is declared in the class component
4. Since it is property binding , enclosed that particular property in square brackets


Now imagine the img tag as child and ProductList component as parent
1. Property binding : From Parent ->Child
2. Add a user defined property to the child component as part of opening tag
3. Getting the value from a variable which is declared in the parent component
4. Since it is property binding , enclosed that particular property in square brackets
companyName is declared in parent component
colors is declared in parent component; 
colors=["red","green","blue"];
selectedProduct={productId:101,productName:"Imac"}
<app-add-to-cart  [myCompanyName]="companyName" [myColours]="colors" [selProduct]="selectedProduct" >
</app-add-to-cart>


1. Can i pass multiple values to the child component? YES
2. Can i pass multiple values of multiple data types to the child component ? YES

Requirement :
Click on one product -- productdetails to be sent to the child component

In the child component:
	-- Specify what is the data which will be received from the parent
		-- data type of the data
		-- number of data 
		-- optional data or mandatory data
		-- alias name for the data
		-- depending on the requirement -- mutate the data or keep it immutable


Decorators:
	-- Starts with an @ symbol
	-- Pass some metadata as object to the decorator
	-- Import the decorator from @angular/core
	-- Decorators transform the element on which it is added
import {Input} from "@angular/core";

Place the following lines inside the child component class(outside the constructor) 
@Input() myCompanyName:string;
@Input() myColours:string[];
@Input() selProduct:Object;


Click on AddToCart button --> showAddToCart becomes true  --> AddToCartComponent is mounted


Constructor
	-- console.log is present in constructor
	-- Constructor is executed only once
	-- First method to be called when the component is mounted
When are the variables going to be getting the data from the parent?
When is the UI populated/loaded?
lifecycle of component?
